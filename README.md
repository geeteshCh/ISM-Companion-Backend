# ISM-Companion-Backend

# Problem Statement
University students often face challenges in staying informed about the wide range of activities and events happening on campus. Additionally, discovering and accessing information about club and organisation induction processes can be difficult and time-consuming, where using google docs for induction is a terrible idea considering its reach in some cases. As a result, students may miss out on opportunities to participate in activities they are interested in or may have difficulty finding and joining clubs that align with their passions and interests. Furthermore, the traditional offline voting system used for SG Elections is offline, making it cumbersome and may discourage students from participating in the democratic process. 
As a result, there is a need for a comprehensive web app that can automate and streamline these processes, providing students with a convenient and efficient way to participate and stay informed about campus activities.

# Solution
This project aims to create an ISM companion web app that gives users easy access to club details, event information, and a blockchain-based voting process for SG Elections. The application also features a companion map to assist users in viewing and navigating campus activities.
* Manual club registration process
  * The student companion app will allow for online club registration, eliminating the need for physical forms and reducing the approval time for clubs.
* Induction process details announced offline
  * The app will include induction process details for each club, providing students with easy access to information about requirements and deadlines.
* Announcement of Clubs events 
  * The app will allow clubs to add events, giving students a more diverse and inclusive selection of events to choose from.
* Offline voting for SG Elections
  * The app will provide a blockchain-based voting system, ensuring fair and accurate results while increasing accessibility for students.
